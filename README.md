Terminal-inspired UI for the web, built for Svelte.

Phosphor is an opinionated UI system for building serious, developer-facing applications:
dashboards, generators, internal tools, and interfaces where clarity and structure matter.

It takes inspiration from TUIs (terminal user interfaces) while remaining fully modern,
accessible, and ergonomic on the web.

## Features

- Built with Svelte 5
- Powered by Bits UI
- MIT licensed
- Copy-paste components

> ⚠️ Early stage. APIs, styles, and component structure may change frequently.

## Why Phosphor Exists

Phosphor exists because I really love TUIs (thanks Dax and the folks at opencode.ai, you converted me so much that I want my websites to look like TUIs, oh and ThePrimeagen too).

As a backend developer constantly building internal tools, generators and dashboards, I noticed that all my apps look the same: like unstyled shadcn and that gets kind of boring after a while. But at the same time I kept missing shadcn-svelte when I wasn’t using it.

So Phosphor is my attempt to grab the parts that make TUIs great, pair them with Bits UI and apply my own spin on top so I can have a TUI inspired system for the web that I actually enjoy using and don’t have to rebuild from scratch in every project.

If it helps others build better developer facing tools too, that’s a very welcome bonus.
